####################################### HDF5.py #########################################
# This code takes a dataset folder as input, and creates a HDF5 formatted file containing
# the dataset.
#
# The folder given as input must have the following structure:
# folder/
#   - fresnelet/ (fresnel-transformed samples)
#      - xxx.jpg
#   - greyscale/ (originals or targets)
#      - xxx.jpg
#
# A fresnelet-transformed sample and its target must have the same file name.
#
# The file given as output must have the ".h5" file extension, and is the file to be used
# as input of train.py.
